The OpenLiteSpeed Rails app automatically installs performance web server OpenLiteSpeed, Ruby and Rails. This image is still in beta! OpenLiteSpeed features easy setup for SSL and RewriteRules. OLS is flexible and also supports Python and Node.js apps, as well as CMSs like WordPress.

## Deploying the Rails OpenLiteSpeed Marketplace App

{{< content "deploy-marketplace-apps-shortguide">}}

**Software installation should complete within 20-25 minutes after the Linode has finished provisioning.**

## Configuration Options

For advice on filling out the remaining options on the **Create a Linode** form, see [Getting Started > Create a Linode](/docs/guides/getting-started/#create-a-linode). That said, some options may be limited or recommended based on this Marketplace App:

- **Supported distributions:** CentOS 7, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Recommended plan:** All plan types and sizes can be used.

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Accessing the Rails OpenLiteSpeed App

1. Once your OpenLiteSpeed Rails app has finished its installation, open a terminal and you will see a prompt as shown in the image below:

    ![OpenLiteSpeed Rails setup information](setupinfo-rails.png)

2. You will be prompted to enter the domain you'd like to use for this instance. You will want to ensure that you have assigned the domain to your Linode. If you would like to utilize the IP address or default RDNS of the Linode, you can skip this by pressing *CTRL+C* in the terminal.
    {{< note >}}
For more documentation on how to assign a domain to your Linode, please review the [DNS Manager](/docs/guides/dns-manager/) guide for instructions on setting up your DNS records in the Cloud Manager, and read through [DNS Records: An Introduction](/docs/guides/dns-records-an-introduction/) for general information about how DNS works.

Now that youâ€™ve accessed your Rails OpenLiteSpeed instance, checkout [the official Rails OpenLiteSpeed documentation](https://docs.litespeedtech.com/cloud/images/rails/) to learn how to further configure your Rails OpenLiteSpeed instance.
