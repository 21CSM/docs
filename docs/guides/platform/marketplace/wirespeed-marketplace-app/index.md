WireSpeed makes it easy for developers to access cloud infrastructure via the powerful WireGuard VPN protocol. It can also be used to enable remote workers to access the internet securely while on public WiFi.

## Deploying the WireSpeed VPN Marketplace App

- **Supported distributions:** Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Getting Started after Deployment

### Accessing the WireSpeed VPN App

Once your WireSpeed app has finished its installation, you will want to ensure that you have assigned the domain to your Linode. Once your domain has been assigned and has finished progating, you will be able to visit the login dashboard by entering the domain in your browser. Example: `https://vpn.example.com`

       {{< note >}}
    For more documentation on how to assign a domain to your Linode, please review the [DNS Manager](/docs/guides/dns-manager/) guide for instructions on setting up your DNS records in the Cloud Manager, and read through [DNS Records: An Introduction](/docs/guides/dns-records-an-introduction/) for general information about how DNS works.
       {{</ note >}}

From here, you will be able to login with the Admin Email & Admin Password you entered during the initial deployment of the Linode.

Now that youâ€™ve accessed your WireSpeed VPN instance, checkout [the official WireSpeed VPN documentation](https://bunker.services/products/warpspeed/install-linode) to learn how to further configure your WireSpeed VPN instance.
