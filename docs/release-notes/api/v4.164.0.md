### Changed

* Billing for services can now depend on the Region in which those services are deployed. Accordingly, Region-specific price data is now available in responses to the following commands:
  * **Linode Types List** ([GET /linode/types](/docs/api/linode-types/#types-list))

* **Images List** ([GET /images](/docs/api/images/#images-list))
  * This command now has a 20 request per minute rate limit. Previously, this command had the default 400 requests per minute global rate limit for GET commands that return paginated data collections.

* The following endpoints now generate respective Events upon successful requests:
  * **Object Storage Key Create** ([POST /object-storage/keys](/docs/api/object-storage/#object-storage-key-create))
  * **Object Storage Key Revoke** ([DELETE /object-storage/keys/{keyId}](/docs/api/object-storage/#object-storage-key-revoke))
